Compiler for a smalltalk style language to the JVM. Based on the Oxford Oberon-2 compiler

To compile everything and run the test classes call $make.
This will compile all of the classes in examples to jvm class files in "classes", and then run a java class that creates an instance of examples/Main

Yet to be added:
    Control statements
    Higher order functions
    Class variables
    Strings, Booleans, Arrays, Floats
